# Deeply-Nested Control Flow

## Exercise
> Exercise branch: **exercise_2**
> 
> Solution branch: **exercise_3**


> 1. Remove the deeply-nested control flow in ```countContainedPoints``` 
>    - use invert if, merge if, and/or remove redundant else (automated refactoring using quickfixes if possible, or manually)

> 2. Extract some self-explanatory, small methods for coordinate validations and count points to remove duplications and make it easier to read.
>    - The validation should read like a newspaper article -> title > lower-level > lowest-level.
