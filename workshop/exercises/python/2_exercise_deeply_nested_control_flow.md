## Exercise

### Remove the deeply-nested control flow in ```count_contained_points```!

## Exercise part 1
> Start by introducing guard clauses and removing duplications using:
>    - ```invert if```
>    - ```merge if```, and/or 
>    - ```remove redundant else```
>

## Exercise part 2
> Improve readability even more by ```extracting methods``` for 
>    - validating coordinates (e.g. ```validate_coordinates(x_coords, y_coords)```) and 
>    - counting points within the circle (e.g. ```count_points_within_circle(x_coords, y_coords)```)
> 
>   
>   to remove duplications and make it easier to read. 
>   You can also think about extracting even smaller functions within 
>   these methods to make it mean something to a human being rather 
>   than a machine.

## Run tests after each reasonably small refactoring step!
