# Comprehensive Checklist for Effective Code Reviews

## Structuring the Code Review

1. **Understand the Review’s Objective**:
    - Enhance code quality
    - Identify bugs
    - Ensure coding best practices
    - Learn from team’s work

2. **Establish Coding Standards**:
    - Naming conventions
    - Formatting styles
    - Commenting practices
    - Relevant rules within the work environment

3. **Conduct Incremental Reviews**:
    - Review code gradually as changes are added to the repository

4. **Use Tools to Automate Mundane Tasks**:
    - Linting
    - Formatting
    - Basic error checking

5. **Prepare Your Code for Review**:
    - Self-review your code
    - Write clear changelist descriptions
    - Narrowly scope changes
    - Separate functional and non-functional changes

## During the Review

1. **Be Constructive and Courteous**:
    - Provide constructive feedback
    - Maintain a friendly tone
    - Avoid personal criticisms

2. **Identify Potential Issues**:
    - Logical bugs
    - Security vulnerabilities
    - Duplicated code
    - Performance inefficiencies
    - Maintainability issues

3. **Prioritize Readability and Maintainability**:
    - Ensure code is easy to understand
    - Improve variable names
    - Simplify complex logic
    - Add clarifying comments

4. **Verify Test Coverage**:
    - Adequate unit tests
    - Tests covering edge cases and error scenarios

5. **Performance Considerations**:
    - Look for performance bottlenecks
    - Efficient algorithms
    - Resource management

## Fostering Collaborative Thinking and Appreciation

1. **Encourage Dialogue and Discussion**:
    - Engage in healthy discussions
    - Explain decisions

2. **Express Gratitude and Acknowledge Work**:
    - Thank individuals for their work
    - Acknowledge effort and time invested

3. **Build Rapport Outside of Code Reviews**:
    - Socialize
    - Pair program
    - Hold daily meetings

4. **Recognize Good Work**:
    - Publicly acknowledge high-quality code
    - Provide positive reinforcement

5. **Lead by Example**:
    - Model constructive behavior
    - Be open to feedback on your code

## Avoiding Conflicts

1. **Avoid Nitpicking**:
    - Use automatic linters for style issues
    - Focus on substantive matters

2. **Leave Clear and Respectful Comments**:
    - Comments should be about the code, not the developer
    - Avoid condescending questions

3. **Handle Pushback Gracefully**:
    - Consider if the developer’s argument makes sense
    - Provide further explanation if necessary
    - Stay polite and respectful

4. **Address Issues Promptly**:
    - Minimize lag between rounds of review
    - Prioritize review completion

## The Code Review Checklist

1. **Functionality**:
    - Does the code fulfill the requirements?
    - Are there any obvious logic errors?
    - Are edge cases and error scenarios handled appropriately?

2. **Readability**:
    - Is the code easy to understand?
    - Are variable and function names clear and descriptive?
    - Are complex sections of code adequately commented?

3. **Maintainability**:
    - Is the code modular and reusable?
    - Are there any redundant or duplicate code segments?
    - Is the code testable and loosely coupled?

4. **Performance**:
    - Are there any obvious performance bottlenecks?
    - Is the code efficient in terms of time and space complexity?
    - Are resources (memory, file handles, etc.) properly managed?

5. **Security**:
    - Are there any potential security vulnerabilities?
    - Are user inputs properly validated and sanitized?
    - Are sensitive data and credentials handled securely?

6. **Testing**:
    - Are there adequate unit tests covering the changes?
    - Do the tests cover edge cases and error scenarios?
    - Are the tests maintainable and easy to understand?

7. **Documentation**:
    - Are code comments clear and informative?
    - Is the high-level documentation updated to reflect the changes?
    - Are any necessary API or user-facing documents updated?

8. **Style and Standards**:
    - Does the code adhere to the team’s coding style guide?
    - Are there any inconsistencies or deviations from the project’s conventions?
    - Are any major style changes kept separate from the main changelist?

## Questions to Ask Yourself During a Code Review
1. Do you approach the process with a positive attitude?
2. Are you nonjudgmental with colleagues?
3. Are you choosy and rejecting reviews only because of nitpicking minutia in the reviewed code?
4. Is competition out of the door?
5. Is the process tedious?
6. Are you making the defects more about the programmer rather than the code?
7. Are you rewarding success?
8. Are you valuing teaching more than critiquing?
9. Are commits gigantic scattered pieces of code that need to be reviewed?
10. Are you using code reviews as a way of improving communication within the team?
11. Are you using code reviews as a learning experience?
12. Are the objectives of the code review clearly defined?
13. Are all asked changes properly prioritized and addressed?
14. Is the review followed by a plan to put in action to fix defects?
15. Are you fully committed as a reviewer?
16. Are you biased by the perception of yourself (e.g., too young or too senior to perform a review)?
17. Are you biased by the perception of others?
18. Are you glancing over code?
19. Do you rebuild and test the code?
20. Do you check that the code is accompanied by additional documentation and tests?
21. If code is unclear, do you ask for clarification?
22. If you asked for a change, do you carefully review again the newer code to ensure important defects have been addressed?
